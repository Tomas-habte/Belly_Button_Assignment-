# Belly Button Assignment
The purpose of this assignment is to visualize bacterial data of volunteers so they can easily find out whether the species found in their navel was identified as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef. We used Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization webpage. Below are examples of what the webpage shows when you select different test subject IDs.
